##################

This is the main folder for the detection/matching/calibration process.
You should put here:
- the images of your dataset
Note that it could fail if the images are not all of the same size. 
JPG and PNG works but other formats have not been tested.
- a K.txt file that contains the intrinsic parameter matrix.
For now, it is not possible to have different K matrices for each pictures.
- a images.txt file to store the name of the pictures and the full location
-lists.txt file is optionnal but it is helpful to use with openMVG for point detection

openMVG folder is where you should save your detections with openMVG if you want to use them for the calibration (works better than with openCV)

pictures folder is optionnal. It is where the visual results will be saved.

##################

Line detection:

LSD_MULTISCALE -d your_current_folder -i images.txt_location [-m 1/0 for multiscale option ON/OFF (default = ON) -t double_threshold threshold for segment detection (default = 0.05% of image size)

Vanishing point detection:
(NEED LINE DETECTION)

VANISHING_POINT -d your_current_folder -i images.txt_location 

Line Matching:
(can be used for line & vanishing point detection)

LINE_MATCHING -d your_current_folder -i images.txt_location [-c 1/0 for consecutive pictures only or all possible matching (default ON) -l 1/0 to compute the matches between first and last picture (default ON) -D 1/0 to compute line detection before (default ON) -m 1/0 for multiscale option ON/OFF (default = ON) -t double_threshold threshold for segment detection (default = 0.02% of image size)]

Bifocal calibration:

CALIBRATION -d your_current_folder -i images.txt_location [-c 1/0 for consecutive pictures only or all possible calibrations (default ON) -l 1/0 to compute the calibration between first and last picture (default ON) -g 0/1/2 ground truth type (default 2) -o 1/0 use openMVG point detection & matching (default ON) -r RANSAC threshold (default is a contrario RANSAC -1)

Ground truth types:
-O nothing
-1 relative calibrations only (see 0000_0001_R.txt file for example)
it has to be 2 files per pair of cameras (one for rotation, one for translation direction) and with a name of the type image1_image2_R/t.txt
-2 global calibrations (see 0000.png.camera file for example)
it has to contain the K matrix first, then 0 0 0 then the rotation matrix and then the camera position:
K
0 0 0
R
t (in row)
it has to be in a file of the type image.png.camera (note that the .png.camera can be disabled in main_calibration.cpp)
